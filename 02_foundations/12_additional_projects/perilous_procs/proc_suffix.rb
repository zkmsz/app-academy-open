# proc_suffix

# Write a method proc_suffix that accepts a sentence and a hash as arguments.
# The hash contains procs as keys and suffix strings as values. The method
# should return a new sentence where each word of the original sentence is
# appended with a suffix if the original word returns true when given to the
# corresponding proc key. If an original word returns true for multiple procs,
# then the suffixes should be appended in the order that they appear in the
# input hash.

# Examples

# contains_a = Proc.new { |w| w.include?('a') }
# three_letters = Proc.new { |w| w.length == 3 }
# four_letters = Proc.new { |w| w.length == 4 }

# p proc_suffix('dog cat',
#     contains_a => 'ly',
#     three_letters => 'o'
# )   # "dogo catlyo"

# p proc_suffix('dog cat',
#     three_letters => 'o',
#     contains_a => 'ly'
# )   # "dogo catoly"

# p proc_suffix('wrong glad cat',
#     contains_a => 'ly',
#     three_letters => 'o',
#     four_letters => 'ing'
# )   # "wrong gladlying catlyo"

# p proc_suffix('food glad rant dog cat',
#     four_letters => 'ing',
#     contains_a => 'ly',
#     three_letters => 'o'
# )   # "fooding gladingly rantingly dogo catlyo"
