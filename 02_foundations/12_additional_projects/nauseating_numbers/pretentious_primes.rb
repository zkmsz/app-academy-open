# pretentious_primes

# Write a method pretentious_primes that takes accepts an array and a number, n,
# as arguments. The method should return a new array where each element of the
# original array is replaced according to the following rules:

# when the number argument is positive, replace an element with the n-th nearest
#   prime number that is greater than the element

# when the number argument is negative, replace an element with the n-th nearest
#   prime number that is less than the element
# For example:

# if element = 7 and n = 1, then the new element should be 11 because 11 is the
#   nearest prime greater than 7

# if the element = 7 and n = 2, then the new element should be 13 because 13 is
#   the 2nd nearest prime greater than 7

# if the element = 7 and n = -1, then the new element should be 5 because 5 is
#   the nearest prime less than 7

# if the element = 7 and n = -2, then the new element should be 3 because 3 is
#   the 2nd nearest prime less than 7

# Note that we will always be able to find a prime that is greater than a given
# number because there are an infinite number of primes (this is given by
# Euclid's Theorem). However, we may be unable to find a prime that is smaller
# than a given number, because 2 is the smallest prime. When a smaller prime
# cannot be calculated, replace the element with nil.

# Examples

# p pretentious_primes([4, 15, 7], 1)           # [5, 17, 11]
# p pretentious_primes([4, 15, 7], 2)           # [7, 19, 13]
# p pretentious_primes([12, 11, 14, 15, 7], 1)  # [13, 13, 17, 17, 11]
# p pretentious_primes([12, 11, 14, 15, 7], 3)  # [19, 19, 23, 23, 17]
# p pretentious_primes([4, 15, 7], -1)          # [3, 13, 5]
# p pretentious_primes([4, 15, 7], -2)          # [2, 11, 3]
# p pretentious_primes([2, 11, 21], -1)         # [nil, 7, 19]
# p pretentious_primes([32, 5, 11], -3)         # [23, nil, 3]
# p pretentious_primes([32, 5, 11], -4)         # [19, nil, 2]
# p pretentious_primes([32, 5, 11], -5)         # [17, nil, nil]
