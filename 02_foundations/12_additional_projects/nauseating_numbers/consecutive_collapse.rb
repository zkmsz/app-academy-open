# consecutive_collapse

# Write a method consecutive_collapse that accepts an array of numbers as an
# argument. The method should return a new array that results from continuously
# removing consecutive numbers that are adjacent in the array. If multiple
# adjacent pairs are consecutive numbers, remove the leftmost pair first.
# For example:

# [3, 4, 1] -> [1]
# because 3 and 4 are consecutive and adjacent numbers, so we can remove them
# [1, 4, 3, 7] -> [1, 7]
# because 4 and 3 are consecutive and adjacent numbers, so we can remove them
# [3, 4, 5] -> [5]

# because 4 and 3 are consecutive and adjacent numbers, we don't target 4 and 5
# since we should prefer to remove the leftmost pair

# We can apply this rule repeatedly until we cannot collapse the array any
# further:

# # example 1
# [9, 8, 4, 5, 6] -> [4, 5, 6] -> [6]

# # example 2
# [3, 5, 6, 2, 1] -> [3, 2, 1] -> [1]
# Code examples

# # p consecutive_collapse([3, 4, 1])                     # [1]
# # p consecutive_collapse([1, 4, 3, 7])                  # [1, 7]
# # p consecutive_collapse([9, 8, 2])                     # [2]
# # p consecutive_collapse([9, 8, 4, 5, 6])               # [6]
# # p consecutive_collapse([1, 9, 8, 6, 4, 5, 7, 9, 2])   # [1, 9, 2]
# # p consecutive_collapse([3, 5, 6, 2, 1])               # [1]
# # p consecutive_collapse([5, 7, 9, 9])                  # [5, 7, 9, 9]
# # p consecutive_collapse([13, 11, 12, 12])              # []
