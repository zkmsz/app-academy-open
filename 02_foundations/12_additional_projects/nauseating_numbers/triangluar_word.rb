# triangular_word?

# A triangular number is a number of the form (i * (i + 1)) / 2 where i is some
# positive integer. Substituting i with increasing integers gives the triangular
# number sequence. The first five numbers of the triangular number sequence are
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. Below is a breakdown of the calculations used to obtain these
# numbers:

# i	(i * (i + 1)) / 2
# 1	1
# 2	3
# 3	6
# 4	10
# 5	15

# We can encode a word as a number by taking the sum of its letters based on
# their position in the alphabet. For example, we can encode "cat" as 24 because
# c is the 3rd of the alphabet, a is the 1st, and t is the 20th:

# 3 + 1 + 20 = 24

# Write a method triangular_word? that accepts a word as an argument and returns

# a boolean indicating whether or not that word's number encoding is a
# triangular number. You can assume that the argument contains lowercase letters.

# Examples

# p triangular_word?('abc')       # true
# p triangular_word?('ba')        # true
# p triangular_word?('lovely')    # true
# p triangular_word?('question')  # true
# p triangular_word?('aa')        # false
# p triangular_word?('cd')        # false
# p triangular_word?('cat')       # false
# p triangular_word?('sink')      # false

def triangular_word?(word)
  triangulars = [1]
