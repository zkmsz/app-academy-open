# Yell Sentence

# Write a method yell_sentence that takes in a sentence string and returns
# a new sentence where every word is yelled. See the examples.
# Use map to solve this.
def yell_sentence(sent)
  sent.split(" ").map { |word| word.upcase + "!" }.join(" ")
end

puts yell_sentence("I have a bad feeling about this")
#=> "I! HAVE! A! BAD! FEELING! ABOUT! THIS!"
